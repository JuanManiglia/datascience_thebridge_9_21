    "\n",
    "K-means is a clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to partition n data points into k clusters. Each of the n data points will be assigned to a cluster with the nearest mean. The mean of each cluster is called its “centroid” or “center”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, applying k-means yields k separate clusters of the original n data points. Data points inside a particular cluster are considered to be “more similar” to each other than data points that belong to other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In our case, we will be clustering the pixel intensities of a RGB image**. Given a MxN size image, we thus have MxN pixels, each consisting of three components: Red, Green, and Blue respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will treat these MxN pixels as our data points and cluster them using k-means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixels that belong to a given cluster will be more similar in color than pixels belonging to a separate cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**One caveat of k-means is that we need to specify the number of clusters we want to generate ahead of time**. There are algorithms that automatically select the optimal value of k."
